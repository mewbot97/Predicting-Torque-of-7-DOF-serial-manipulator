# Predicting-Torque-of-7-DOF-serial-manipulator

This project was done as part of "Computer science in Mechanical Engineering II" course offered by RWTH AACHEN.<br/>
The objective was to predict the torque of the first joint of a 7 DOF serial manipulator given its joint parameters.<br/>
Core Algorithms have been implemented manually without the use of any libraries to strengthen understanding of the topic.<br/>
The study was done using Simple Linear regression, Polynomial Linear regression, and Linear regression with Radial Basis functions.<br/>
